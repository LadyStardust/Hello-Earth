Hello, Earth!
Hello, Earth!
With just one hand held up high
I can blot you out,
Out of sight.

Peek-a-boo,
Peek-a-boo, little Earth.
With just my heart and my mind
I can be driving,
Driving home,
And you asleep
On the seat.

I get out of my car,
Step into the night
And look up at the sky.
And there's something bright,
Traveling fast.
Look at it go!
Look at it go!

Watching storms
Start to form
Over America.
Can't do anything.
Just watch them swing
With the wind
Out to sea.

Go to sleep, little Earth.
I was there at the birth,
Out of the cloudburst,
The head of the tempest.
Murderer!
Murder of calm.
Why did I go?
Why did I go?
